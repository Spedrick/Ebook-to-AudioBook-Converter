# Ebook-to-AudioBook-Converter

A while ago I was messing around with google's Text to Speech python library.
This library basically reads out any piece of text and converts it to .mp3 file. Then I started thinking of making something useful out of it.

So I started planning how the script should look like.

   Allow user to pick a .pdf file
   Convert the file into one string
   Output .mp3 file.



# Requirements

```
pip install pdftotext
```
```
pip install gtts
```
